      <p> Scobbuy, is an Indian e-commerce company based in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was founded by Mukul kumar in 2020. The company initially focused on all sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Scobbuy Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Scobbuy in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
